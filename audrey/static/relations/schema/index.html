    </header>
    <p>
    The "schema" relation is used to indicate a link to a <a href="http://json-schema.org">JSON Schema</a> document.  Collections include such links to describe the schema for each type of child resource that can be added to the collection.
    </p>
    <p>
    Every schema link object has a "name" property containing a string representating the name of an Object type.
    </p>
    <p>
    While on the topic of creating new resources, note that collections have a state property "_factory" whose value is an object with the following properties:

    <table class="table">
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>schemas</td>
      <td>A list of the object types that can be created in this collection.  The list contains strings that can be correlated with the names of the "schema" links.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>method</td>
      <td>The HTTP method to be used to create new child objects.  For naming collections this will be PUT.  For non-naming collections it will be POST.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
