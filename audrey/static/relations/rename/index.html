      <h1>Audrey Link Relations</h1>
      <h2>"rename" rel</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
    The "rename" relation is used to indicate a link from a collection to an endpoint for POSTing a request to rename a child resource.  Such a link will only exist for collections that allow explicit control over child naming.
    </p>
    <p>
    Requests to a collection's "rename" endpoint should use the POST method and the application/json content type.  The body of the request should be a JSON object with the keys: "from_name" and "to_name" whose values are strings indicating the old and new names. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>{
    "from_name": "foo",
    "to_name": "bar"
}</pre>
    <p>

      <th>Status</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>204 No Content</td>
      <td>
      The rename was successful. The response includes Location and Content-Location headers with the url of the renamed child resource.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>400 Bad Request</td>
      <td>
      The rename was not allowed (non-unique or invalid new name).  The body of the response is a JSON object with an "error" property explaining the reason.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>404 Not Found</td>
      <td>
      No child object exists with the value of "from_name".
      </td>
    </tr>
