      <h1>Audrey Link Relations</h1>
      <h2>"reference" rel</h2>
    </header>
    <p>
    The "reference" relation is used to indicate a link from one Audrey Object to another.  This relation may also be used to for _embedded objects.
    </p>
    <h3>Reference Links</h3>
    <p>
    Every reference link object has a "name" property containing a string representation of the referenced object's ObjectId.  As such, the "name" can be used to uniquely identify a specific reference link.  The ObjectId strings can be cross-referenced with "ObjectId" values found in an Object's state properties to determine the corresponding link for a given property.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each reference link object has a "title" property containing a string representing the title of the referenced object.
    </p>
    <h3>Embedded References</h3>
    <p>
    When referenced objects are embedded, they will have an "_id" in their state properties whose value is an object with an "ObjectId" property containing a string representation of the referenced object's ObjectId.
    These ObjectId strings can be cross-referenced with "ObjectId" values in the embedding Object's state properties to determine the embedded resource that corresponds to a given property.
