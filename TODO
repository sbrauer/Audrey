[ ] Keep unittests and nose coverage up to date

[x] Implement basic Mongo stuff

[x] Implement Elastic stuff

[ ] Implement RESTful views (for CRUD, "forms" and search)

[ ] Setup a pcreate scaffold, and create a demo app that uses it.
    The demo app should include a frontend that uses Knockout.
    What should the demo app be?  A blog maybe?

[ ] Add support for files and GridFS (and Elastic attachment support?)

[ ] In REST views, treat files as separate resources.
    Example: /people/sam-brauer/photo (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    If an object has a list of files, support POST too:
    Example: /galleries/robots/photos/

[ ] Implement HierarchicalCollection and FolderObject

[ ] Take a closer look at pyelasticsearch as an alternative to pyes
