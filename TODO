=======

[ ] Keep unittests and nose coverage up to date

[ ] Keep documentation up to date

Alpha 
=====

[x] Implement basic Mongo stuff

[x] Implement Elastic stuff

[x] Implement RESTful views (for CRUD, "forms" and search)

[x] Setup a pcreate scaffold

[x] Flesh out support for inter-object references and be sure to link
    to referenced objects in "_links" section of object GET view
    (with a new namespaced "reference" rel)

[ ] Create a utility for keeping references on the other end of
    many-to-many relationships up to date when a context object is saved.

[ ] Implement HierarchicalCollection and FolderObject

[x] Add support for files and GridFS

Maybe?
======

[ ] Rethink use of request throughout resource classes... can we ditch
    it?  grep request resources/*.py
    [ ] Change root_factory and Root so that request.registry.settings is
        passed to Root intead of request (for access to Mongo, Elastic, etc).
    [ ] Change Object.get_class_schema() such that it doesn't take a request
        arg and instead uses a schema defined by a class attribute.
        Change Object.get_schema() such that request is required, but the
        default implementation just returns get_class_schema().  Subclasses
        that need to customize the schema based on request can do so in a deepcopy.
    [ ] change File such that it's passed the gridfs instead of request
    [ ] update tests
    [ ] update scaffold
    [ ] update docs!

[ ] Index files in Elastic using its support for attachments

[ ] In REST views, treat files as separate resources.
    Example: /people/sam-brauer/photo (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    If an object has a list of files, support POST too:
    Example: /galleries/robots/photos/

[ ] Take a closer look at pyelasticsearch as an alternative to pyes
