=======

[ ] Keep unittests and nose coverage up to date

[ ] Keep documentation up to date

Alpha 
=====

[x] Implement basic Mongo stuff

[x] Implement Elastic stuff

[x] Implement RESTful views (for CRUD, "forms" and search)

[x] Setup a pcreate scaffold

[x] Flesh out support for inter-object references and be sure to link
    to referenced objects in "_links" section of object GET view
    (with a new namespaced "reference" rel)

[ ] Create a utility for keeping references on the other end of
    many-to-many relationships up to date when a context object is saved.

[ ] Implement HierarchicalCollection and FolderObject

[x] Add support for files and GridFS

Maybe?
======

[ ] Index files in Elastic using its support for attachments

[ ] In REST views, treat files as separate resources.
    Example: /people/sam-brauer/photo (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    If an object has a list of files, support POST too:
    Example: /galleries/robots/photos/

[ ] Take a closer look at pyelasticsearch as an alternative to pyes
