[ ] Start unittests!!!  Run nose coverage.

[x] Implement basic Mongo stuff

[ ] Implement Elastic stuff

[ ] Implement RESTful views

[ ] Add support for files and GridFS (and Elastic attachment support?)

[ ] In REST views, treat files as separate resources.
    Example: /people/sam-brauer/photo (GET, PUT, DELETE)
    If an object has a list of files, support POST too:
    Example: /galleries/robots/photos/

[ ] Setup a pcreate scaffold, and create a demo app that uses it.
    The demo app should include a frontend that uses Knockout.
    What should the demo app be?  A blog maybe?

[ ]  take a closer look at pyelasticsearch as an alternative to pyes
