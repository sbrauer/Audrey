Audrey aims to be a minimal framework for creating [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) applications that use [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) for persistence, [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) for fulltext search (optional), [traversal](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.4-branch/narr/traversal.html) for resource/view lookup, and [colander](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colander) for schema declaration and user input validation.

Audrey also provides views that implement a RESTful API.  In an attempt to satisfy the hypermedia constraint (HATEOAS), GET responses use the [HAL+JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) mediatype.  In a further attempt to be self-describing, links to [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) documents (generated automatically from your types' colander schemas) are provided for POST and PUT requests.

My goal is to keep Audrey otherwise unopinionated.  For example, Audrey intentionally does nothing regarding authentication, authorization, permissions, etc.  A developer building on Audrey can make those decisions as appropriate for their app and implement them using standard Pyramid facilities.
